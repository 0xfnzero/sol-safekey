# FnzeroSafe Mobile Internal Test Checklist

## Build

- Run `apps/mobile/tool/bootstrap_mobile.sh` after installing Flutter.

  - Build with JDK 17: `flutter build appbundle`.
- iOS release signing:
  - Install the matching iOS platform from Xcode > Settings > Components.
  - Verify `xcrun simctl list runtimes` shows at least one iOS runtime.
  - Run `flutter build ios --no-codesign`, then configure signing/profile/archive in Xcode.
